# Part 1. Kafka Basics

In this part, we need to start ZooKeeper and Kafka.
This means running in two terminals (tabs or panes within a terminal tab):

- `./1_start_zookeeper.sh`
- `./2_start_kafka.sh`

Then, the topics used in this setup need to be created (by running `./3_create_topics.sh` script).
That script also showcase how to change / update a config element of an existing topic.
